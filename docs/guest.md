# Guests

Guests who have been invited to a group or attended a meeting can be added to ChamberForge.  

## Add a Guest

There are two ways to add a guest: through the Guests screen and through a meeting page.

The screen for adding guests is very similar to the Add a Member screen.  The only required field is the name field - rest of the fields are optional.  You can also choose which member has invited the guest.

Click on the Guests from left navigation menu and then Add New to add a new guest.
