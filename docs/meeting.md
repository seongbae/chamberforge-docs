## Track Attendance

After a meeting has been created, you can track attendance by going to the meeting details screen and clicking on Update Attendance button.  You will see members and guests of the group with checkbox next to their name.  Simply check the checkbox to denote the member or guest's meeting attendance.

If you have a large group, checking each checkbox can be a tedious process.  You can check all by checking the topmost checkbox.
